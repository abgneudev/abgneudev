I've spent 3+ years shipping 19 software projects across global enterprises, startups, and freelance clients. I think in systems, design with accessibility in mind, and build production-ready components in React and Flutter.

- 🌱 Blending **Product Design, Web Development & Data Science**
- 🚀 Drove 2x faster shipping cycles by eliminating design-to-code handoffs
- 🏆 Won Impact Award at AWS Women in AI Hackathon 2025

### What I Build

I specialize in accessible design systems (WCAG 2.2 AA compliant) and scalable component libraries. Whether it's a React web tool, a Flutter mobile app, or a full-stack AI platform with FastAPI and LangGraph, I take ideas from Figma to production.

Work:
- [Survey Tool](https://github.com/abgneudev/meditation-personality-quiz) (Typeform clone that saved $25/month, Next.js & Supabase)

Academic projects:
- [CourseGPT](https://github.com/abgneudev/LearningAssistant) (RAG-powered AI learning platform with LangGraph, FastAPI & Streamlit)
- [App Prototype](https://github.com/abgneudev/Lab_Results) (Redesign of Epic's Labs Results User Flow)

Personal hacks:
